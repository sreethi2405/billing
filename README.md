# Stock Pinger
An upgraded Billing System that carries the data about buffer stock of products. This system notifies the admin of store as soon as the quantity reaches the buffer stock limit since the demand for that product has increased. Now the store has to increase the supply of products to meet the customer needs by refilling the stocks before they go empty.
